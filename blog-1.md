# Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds optional static typing. It compiles to plain JavaScript, which means it can run in any environment where JavaScript runs.

## Benefits of TypeScript

1. **Static Typing**: Helps catch type-related errors during development.
2. **Intellisense**: Offers code autocompletion and hints, improving productivity.
3. **Better Code Structure**: Allows the use of classes, interfaces, and modules for a more organized codebase.

## Example: Type Annotation

```typescript
let age: number = 25;
let name: string = "Alice";
